# Feelings-Landing Page

Landing page created for 2017 Hack The Violence Hack-athon, hosted by Goodie Nation in Atlanta, GA. This page was created for an app to be created by local college student.

Purpose of app is to introduce Elementary school students to another explaination and understanding of feelings and provide a means for them to easily share them through interactive questions, activities, and games. The mascot was created to further illustrate that feelings will come and go like the clouds, and that the moment and feelings shall pass in time. 

The landing page earned our group 2nd place in this Hack-athon, and provided me with great experience and motivation to continue to work on my craft of coding.

The layout was an easy task to achieve, but my proudest acomplishment is certainly the animations of the clouds poking in and out of frame.
